This is the source code for my [personal website](http://sixteenms.com/), written with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).  I used the [gatsby-material-starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter) as a starting point, though decided I preferred Bootstrap to Material for the look (I am currently in the works of replacing the starter code with my own).

I am using this project not only to create a long needed personal website, but also to practice some web development.  I chose GatsbyJS because I wanted a static site generator that could handle content driven generation with filetypes like Markdown.  I also wanted something a bit more robust than the standard static site generator like Jekyll, and I discovered that I really enjoy developing in ReactJS.
