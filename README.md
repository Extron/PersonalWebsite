This is the source code for my [personal website](http://sixteenms.com/), written with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).  I used the [gatsby-material-starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter) as a starting point, though I decided that I preferred Bootstrap to Material for the look, and used [gatsby-starter-bootstrap](https://github.com/jaxx2104/gatsby-starter-bootstrap) as a reference.

I am using this project not only to create a long needed personal website, but also to practice some web development. I chose GatsbyJS because I wanted a static site generator that could handle content driven generation with filetypes like Markdown. I also wanted something a bit more robust than the standard static site generator like Jekyll, and I discovered that I really enjoy developing in ReactJS.
