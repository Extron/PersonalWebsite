I took composition lessons in my youth from [Len Rhodes](https://lenrhodesmusic.com/), who founded the [Pikes Peak Young Composers competition](https://summitmusicandarts.org/pages/young-composers-competition) (it has since been changed to the Summit Young Composers Competition). For archival purposes, I have chosen to list the pieces I wrote that I can still find here.

## Zion - May 2011
[Sheet Music - PDF](./zion-tbj.pdf)

This was one of the first orchestral pieces that I attempted. It was inspired by the story and setting of a video game some friends and I were developing at the time, in which there was a city called Zion. I largely based the structure and instruments on [Felix Mendelssohn's _The Hebrides Overture_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3MiETaBSnc) I submitted this piece for the 2011 Pikes Peak Young Composers competition.

Instruments: Piccolo, Flute, Oboe, Clarinet, Bassoon, Horn, Trumpet, Trombone, Timpani, Violin, Viola, Cello, Bass

[Sheet Music - PDF](./the-underwater-city-tbj.pdf)

Partly inspired by [Debussy's Underwater Cathedral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAVyKDDsM3s), as well as the video game [Bioshock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock), this piece contains six themes, each one centered on a different aspect of an underwater city. Written for the 2010 Pikes Peak Young Composers competition.

Instruments: Piano

## Desolation/Schizophrenia - May 2009
[Sheet Music - PDF](./desolation-tbj.pdf)

This piece, which continues the atonality and abnormal time signatures started by _The Raven_, was originally titled _Schizophrenia_, and was inspired by my grandmother, who suffers from the mental disease. I changed the name to _Desolation_, in order to have a more musical and thematic title as part of the 2009 Pikes Peak Young Composers competition. Ultimately though, I still prefer _Schizophrenia_ as I believe it more apply frames the themes of the piece.

Instruments: Piano

## Astrum Lumen - May 2007
[Sheet Music - PDF](./astrum-lumen-tbj.pdf)

This was my first attempt at writing a string quartet. The title is Latin for "starlight". I wrote this piece for the 2007 Pikes Peak Young Composers competition.

Instruments: Violin, Viola, Cello

## The Raven - May 2006
[Sheet Music - PDF](./the-raven-tbj.pdf)

A piece written for the 2006 Pikes Peak Young Composers competition. Inspired by [Edgar Allen Poe's _The Raven_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raven), this was my first experiment with both atonality and unusual time signatures. I would continue to write atonal pieces in the years that followed.

Instruments: Piano
